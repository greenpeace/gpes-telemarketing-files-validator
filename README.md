# Telemarketing files validator

Itâ€™s a browser based debugging application that inspects files to be uploaded in Salesforce and returns error messages. Agencies are supposed to use it before uploading files. Greenpeace Spain will maintain it.

## History

This application was started in September 2016 as a temporary solution to solve the problem of frequent issues with files to be uploaded in Salesforce. It was supposed to be abandoned in 2021, but it had a revival in 2022 as we are updating the file formats with 3 agencies.

## Hosted validator

## Edit the validators rules

The folder `validators` contain the file specific validators rules.

The file `src/js/tlmkValidator.js` is a general library with an object that's inherited by all specific file validators. This object is inherited and can be overwriten.

Other code is in the `src` folder.
